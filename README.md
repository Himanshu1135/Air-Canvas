It is a fun and interactive way to create art and can be used for educational purposes such as teaching young children how to draw or for online tutoring sessions.

Air Canvas also provides a feature to save the drawing as an image file, making it easy to share with others. The program uses a simple and intuitive user interface, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

Air Canvas can also be used for remote collaboration, as users can share their screens and draw on the virtual canvas together. It provides a unique and innovative way to communicate and collaborate in real-time.

Overall, Air Canvas is a fun and creative way to draw and is a great tool for educational and collaborative purposes. It demonstrates the potential of computer vision technology and its use in enhancing user experience.
